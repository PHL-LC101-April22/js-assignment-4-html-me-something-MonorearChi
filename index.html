         <h2><b>Hiking</b></h2>
         <p>I have always loved hiking either in differernt trails around Philadelphia and Easton. It is a great way
            for me to unstress myself and enjoy nature to it fullest. As I have moved to Easton PA, my favorite place to
            walk is at the Delware River walking trail, which is a very scenice route around the down towan Easton Area.
            There are a few different routes a person can take they are either into the forest area or a stroll towards
            the city. Depending on how I feel, I would choose either or.

      <h3><b>Painting</b></h3>
      <p>I started my love for painting when I deciede to have a cute date nigth with my boyfriend one day while we
         were eating popcorn. It was always an activity that I have always wanted to try doing and I realise how
         enjoyable and relaxing it was. The meme of Ms.Puff with her weird looking nose was the first paining I had ever
         made. This was where it had all started.

         <h4><b>Journaling</b></h4>
         <p>Jounraling has been one of my ways to be able to cope with my depression and express my self in a form
            where there is creativity and imagination involved. This had led me to be intrested in cute statioanries,
            journals and fun deign ideas. Each page is different and unique in its own way.

      <h5><b>Baking</b></h5>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I am not that great of a cook, but when it comes to baking I really enjoy it
         and its a great way to be
         in the
         kitchen with out messing up the ingirents. I did not start baking until I met my current bf where when were
         just friends, I had always cane over to his apartments and ask to bake brownies. Until this day many months
         later, baking has been one of the hobbies that I enjoy along with many others.
